# SoundLoc-EQ
this project focuses on eliminating quantization errors in classification-based sound source localization. quantization errors can reduce accuracy, leading to unreliable results. by improving how these errors are handled, we aim to enhance the precision and reliability of sound source localization, especially in noisy or data-limited environments.
